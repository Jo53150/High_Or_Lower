# Follower Comparison Game

This repository contains a Python project for a simple follower comparison game. The game challenges players to compare the number of followers of two social media profiles and guess which one has more followers.

## Project Overview

The game includes the following features:

- **Random Comparisons**: The game randomly selects two profiles from a dataset and displays their information.
- **User Input**: Players input their guess on which profile has more followers.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score and ends when a wrong guess is made.

## How It Works

1. **Profile Comparison**: Two profiles are randomly selected and displayed to the player.
2. **User Guess**: The player guesses which profile has more followers by typing 'A' or 'B'.
3. **Score Update**: If the guess is correct, the player's score is updated. If the guess is incorrect, the game ends and displays the final score.

## Installation

To set up and run the follower comparison game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/follower-comparison-game.git
   cd follower-comparison-game
   ```
2. **Run the Game**:
